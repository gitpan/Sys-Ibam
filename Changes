Revision history for Perl extension Sys::Ibam.

0.05  Tue Apr  5 20:14:34 2005
	- New ibam.{inl,hpp}.
	- Changed implemention details of the conversion from c(++) datatypes to
	  perl types (we now use PERL_MAGIC_ext).
	- Added optional do_second_correction option to constructor.
	- Integrated automatical corrections.

0.04  Sat Apr  2 05:14:04 2005
	- Updated ibam.{inl,hpp} with a pmu aware version.

0.03  Sun Jan  9 13:18:07 2004
	- Removed constant-{c,xs}.inc and related stuff.
	- Added code to make intelligent guesses about what compiler to use to
	  Makefile.PL. Most of it is stolen from Neil Watkiss' Inline::CPP module.
	- Added a useful documentation.
	- Removed load_{battery,charge} bindings.
	- profile_filename() now takes a string as its second argument.
	- current_profile_type() now returns a string, not a number. That's more
	  readable and understandable. So there's no need for constants anymore.
	- set_profile_logging() evaluates its argument correct. There's no need to
	  pass 0 or 1 anymore. Every boolean expression will work.
	- onBattery() was renamed to on_battery().

0.02  Mon Dez 27 21:48:02 2004
	- Make proper use of XS.

		-O -n Sys::Ibam
